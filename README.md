### What I Learned

During this project, I had the opportunity to enhance my skills in building responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are a few code snippets from the project:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to further focus on refining and perfecting my skills in front-end development. I want to continue learning new concepts and techniques, improving my problem-solving abilities, and staying updated with the latest web development trends.

### Useful Resources

Here are some additional resources that helped me during the challenge:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This platform proved to be invaluable for troubleshooting and finding solutions to specific coding issues. The active community of developers on Stack Overflow provided me with helpful insights and guidance.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools served as a comprehensive reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tutorials and examples provided clear explanations and helped me solidify my understanding of various concepts.

These resources were instrumental in my learning process and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking further knowledge in web development.
